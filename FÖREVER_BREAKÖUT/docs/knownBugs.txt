1. Two different types of power-ups that're active at the
   same time will interfere with the Big Ball timer.
	-- However, if one of the power-ups gets "destroyed", 
	   the timer functions as normal.

2. By hitting the Ball on the Player Height (the short ends),
   the Player may perform a "backhand" smash.

3. (Maybe) if the Ball hits a Brick from the side, it may
   "freakout" and mow through several Bricks at once.

4. If the Player picks up the Big Ball Power-Up when the Ball is all 
   to the sides of the window, the Ball size will "clip" outside of the screen.
	-- Which makes the Big Ball form get stuck.
